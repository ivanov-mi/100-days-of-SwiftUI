From [WeSplit: Wrap up](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/wesplit-wrap-up)
>1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”.
>2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
>3. Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range 0..<101 for your range rather than a fixed array.

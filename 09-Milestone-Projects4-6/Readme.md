# Milestone III: Projects 4-6

[Day 35](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/35) – Milestone: Projects 4-6

## Challenges

From [Milestone: Projects 4-6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge)

>Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their core, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.
>
>Breaking it down:
>
>- The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
>- The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
>- You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
>
>If you want to go fully down the “education” route then this is going to be some steppers, a text field and a couple of buttons. I would suggest that’s a good place to start, just to make sure you have the basics covered.
>
>Once you have that, it’s down to you how far you want to take the app down the “entertainment” route – you could throw away fixed controls like Stepper entirely if you wanted, and instead rely on colorful buttons to get the same result.
>
>This is one of those challenges that is best approached step by step: get something working first, then improve it as far as you want. Maybe you’re happy with a simple app, or maybe you really want to spend some time crafting a fun design. It’s down to you!

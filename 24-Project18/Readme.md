## Challenges

From [Layout and geometry: Wrap up](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/layout-and-geometry-wrap-up)

>1. Make views near the top of the scroll view fade out to 0 opacity – I would suggest starting at about 200 points from the top.
>2. Make views adjust their scale depending on their vertical position, with views near the bottom being large and views near the top being small. I would suggest going no smaller than 50% of the regular size.
>3. For a real challenge make the views change color as you scroll. For the best effect, you should create colors using the Color(hue:saturation:brightness:) initializer, feeding in varying values for the hue.

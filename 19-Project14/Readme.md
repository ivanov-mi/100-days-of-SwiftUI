## Challenges

From [Bucket List: Wrap up](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-wrap-up)

>1. Allow the user to switch map modes, between the standard mode and hybrid.
>2. Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication, so add code to show those errors in an alert.
>3. Create another view model, this time for EditView. What you put in the view model is down to you, but I would recommend leaving dismiss and onSave in the view itself – the former uses the environment, which can only be read by the view, and the latter doesn’t really add anything when moved into the model.
